# vpnbypass
VPN bypass for specific domains  
  
**Dependencies:** gtk2 polkit bind-utils  
  
Sometimes it becomes necessary, with the VPN turned on, to go to sites that are blocked for visitors from other countries (geolocation binding). In this case, to bypass your own VPN, you can add "exceptions", i.e. routes to all possible IPs of this domain.
